        <ul>
            <li>Personal background: I was born in Greensboro, NC, and grew up in a small town north of Greensboro, called Reidsville.  </li>
            <li>Professional: Basically, I've worked any job that was available at the time.  Everything from making smoothies at Smoothie King to hacking through miles of overgrown wetlands with a machete for a surveying group.</li>
            <li>Academic background: I went to Rockingham County High, and then to UNCC.</li>
            <li>Background in the subject matter of this course:  Not much, actually.  I've played around with HTML a little, and designed some simple apps, but with tools designed for beginnners. </li>
            <li>Primary Computer Platform: Windows 10</li>
            <li>Courses I'm taking and reason for each: 
                <ul>
                    <li>ITIS 3200 - Intro to Security - taking this to learn about security systems and measures</li>
                    <li>ITIS 4350 - Rapid Prototyping - Gotta learn how to prototype... rapidly, I guess</li>
                    <li>Psyc 1101 - Introduction to Psychology - this is required for my concentration, and it's apparently pretty easy.</li>
                    <li>ITIS 3135 - Web App Design - I wanna design Web Apps!</li>
                  
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember you by:
                I donated my body to science in school to earn money - in one experiment i got $500 for letting them inject me with radioactive water for a PET scan. I'll always wonder...</li>
            <li>I'd also like to share:
                I'm hoping to make a vlogging channel that covers my adventures as a middle-aged dad.</li>
        </ul>
